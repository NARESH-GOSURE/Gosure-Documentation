## Job Type Creation Overview

- A job type refers to a blueprint or a predefined template or a set of configurations that define a specific type of job or task. 
- It outlines the characteristics, properties, and behaviours of a particular job or task.

## Job Type Creation: Version 1 vs Version 2

### Version 1: 
    - In Version 1, creating a job type is a straightforward process thanks to an inbuilt UI design. 
         - This allows users to create a job type that meets their specific needs without requiring external tools or technical expertise.

### Version 2: 
    - In contrast, Version 2 takes a more technical approach to job type creation. Instead of using an inbuilt UI, users must utilize Postman, an external API client, to create a job type. 
        - This involves configuring an API request by passing the required parameters and properties for the specific job type. 
            - This approach provides more flexibility and control, but may require more technical knowledge and expertise.

### Editing Job Parameters
- Once a job type is created, it's not set in stone. We provide the flexibility to make changes to the job type as needed.

#### UI-Level Edit Controls:  
    - To facilitate editing, we offer intuitive UI-level edit controls specifically designed for the job type. 
      - These controls allow users to easily modify the job type's parameters and properties, ensuring that the job type remains aligned with their evolving needs.

## List of Job Parameters
- When editing a job type, the following parameters can be modified:
### 1. ID:
    - The ID is a unique identifier automatically generated by the system. 
        - For example, in the "Clientele" job type, the system generates a unique ID for that specific job type.
### 2. Name:
    - The Name parameter represents the actual name of the job type.
### 3. description:
    - The Description field provides a brief summary of the job type's purpose, giving users a clear understanding of what the job type is intended for.
### 4. Published:
    - The Published parameter indicates the visibility and accessibility of the job type.
        - If the job type is Published, it becomes available and accessible through the user interface (UI), allowing users to interact with it. 
            - On the other hand, if the job type is not published, it remains hidden from the UI and can only be used internally through the backend.
### 5. Is Sub Type:
    - In our system, we have two categories of job types: Main Job Type and Sub Job Type. The Sub Type feature determines the behaviour of a job type as either a main job or a sub job.
        - By default, the job type is set as a sub job. This configuration allows the sub job to function as both a sub job and a main job, providing flexibility in managing job types.
            - Enabling the job type as a sub job expands its capabilities, allowing it to serve as a main job when required. This dual functionality simplifies job management and ensures a more streamlined process.

### How Subjobs Work:
- Subjobs are closely related to main jobs, and their relationship is established through a Parent ID. 
- Each subjob is identified by its corresponding main job's ID, which serves as its parent ID.
- This hierarchical structure enables efficient management and filtering of subjobs.
#### Here's how it works:
    - When a main job is loaded, its associated subjobs are also retrieved based on their parent ID.
    - The subjobs are then filtered according to their parent ID, ensuring that only the relevant subjobs are displayed in relation to the main job.
- This parent-child relationship between main jobs and subjobs streamlines the job management process, making it easier to organize and access related subjobs.


### 6. Icon: 
    - The Icon feature allows users to associate a visual representation with a job type. 
        - This icon serves as a unique identifier for the job type, making it easily recognizable and distinguishable from other job types.

### 7.  Template: 
    - The Template feature enables the download of job type information in a predefined format. 
        - This feature simplifies the process of exporting job type data, ensuring that it is presented in a consistent and organized manner.


### 8. Upload Sample Template: 
    - This feature allows users to upload a sample template format, which can then be downloaded by others.

### 9. Is Email Template: 
    - Enabling the Email Template feature in a job type allows you to use pre-defined email templates when creating emails as part of that job type. 
        - This can be helpful if you frequently send similar emails and want to save time by not having to write out the same content over and over again. 
            - Once this feature is enabled, you can easily select one of the configured email templates from a list, which can then be automatically inserted into the email when you're creating it.

### 10. Is Attachment Email Template: 
    - The Attachment Email Template feature is related to the Email Template feature, but it specifically deals with attachments that may need to be included with the email. 
        - When this feature is enabled, the system will check if there are any attachments that need to be added to the email based on the selected email template. 
            - This can be helpful if certain types of emails always need to include specific attachments.

### 11. Parent Job Type: 
    - The 'Parent Job Type' feature identifies the parent job type and creates its instance whenever the system requires it.

### 12. Parent Job Identifier:
    - The 'Parent Job Identifier' is a unique identifier used to identify its own parent job type, allowing for clear association and tracking.
### 13. Identifier:  
    - The 'Identifier' serves a similar purpose as the 'Parent Job Identifier', providing a unique identifier for the job type.

### 14. Promote Trackable Changes to Parent: 
    - The 'Promote Trackable Changes to Parent' feature enables the tracking of changes made at the sub-job level, which is pushed to the parent level for recording them in the activity logs along with details of who made the changes and when they were made. 
        - Instead of track all field, we can also able to track the important field level to parents.

### 15. Risk Score Property:  
    - The 'Risk Score Property' feature retrieves the risk score from the job type data, allowing it to be aggregated and displayed as a risk percentage in a gauge meter.

### 16. Max Risk Score Property: 
    - The 'Max Risk Score Property' feature retrieves the maximum risk score from the job type data, enabling it to be aggregated and displayed as the maximum risk score in a gauge meter.

### 17. On Submit Actions: 
    - The 'On Submit Actions' feature enables the execution of custom actions upon form submission, allowing for automated workflows and streamlined processes.

### 18. Download URLS: 
    - The 'Download URLs' feature provides users with the ability to customize their downloads, selecting specific fields and formats to retrieve the desired data in a convenient and flexible manner. Ex Insurance cards.

### 19.  Limited Field Roles: 
    - The 'Limited Field Roles' feature allows administrators to define which roles are eligible to access Limited fields, enabling controlled data entry and reducing the need to fill in entire details.

### 20. DisplayAPI: 
    - The 'DisplayAPI' feature enables seamless integration with external APIs, allowing our system to fetch and display relevant data from external sources, providing a unified view of information.


### 21. Association Rule: 
    - Instead of creating multiple sub-jobs for a particular job type, where the data varies, we can establish an association rule between them. 
        - If the association is removed, there is no relationship between the two instances. 
            - Moreover, we can visualize the associated instances for this particular job, providing a clear understanding of the relationships between main jobs and sub-jobs


### 22. EnableWizard: 
    - The 'EnableWizard' feature provides the flexibility to activate a guided wizard experience for specific job types, simplifying the job creation process and ensuring accuracy and consistency.

### 23. IsGraphSubscription, is PrimaryEnabled& IsGmail Subscription: 
    - The 'IsGraphSubscription', 'IsPrimaryEnabled', and 'IsGmailSubscription' features enable seamless email integration from various sources, including Gmail and Outlook, and automatically create jobs in our system, streamlining workflow and increasing efficiency.

### 24. allowPublicAccess: 
    - The 'allowPublicAccess' feature enables anonymous access to specific job types, allowing users to view and interact with them without requiring a login, thereby increasing accessibility and convenience.

### 25. downloadFilteredTemplateData: 
    - The 'Download Filtered Template Data' feature allows users to export customized data that has been tailored to their specific needs, enabling them to download only the relevant information that meets their filtering criteria.
